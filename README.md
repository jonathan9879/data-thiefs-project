# Pollution is in the air!

We decided we wanted to have more insights on the air pollution. We did a statistical analysis of several sources to give some useful insights into what is the current situation on air pollution in the world and what trends exist for the future.

## Team
Alvaro, Chun and Jessie

## Topics
PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair. We focused on this air contaminant in particular because of the clear difference between other contaminants and PM2.5

It is one of the hardest enviromental problems we face for the mid-term future and we believe we should start focusing on how to minimize it now, not when it's too late.

## Questions
What is the general trend of mean exposure worldwide?
What countries have out of the ordenary trends/data?
How many deaths does this contaminant cause yearly?
Is it likely to be a problem in the future?
Are we probably breathing it right now?
Where does it come from and what can we do?
