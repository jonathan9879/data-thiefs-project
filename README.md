# Welcome to Data Thiefs project!

In this project you will need to get all the information by yourself :scream: 

## Project Goals

* Give some insights about a topicof your choice giving some arguments.
* Choose the data interesting for your questions. 
* Have all the data you are using in a database the whole team will use.
* Use different types of sources for your data: files, databases, APIs, web scrapping.
* Explain more complex arguments with plots.


## Some hints
* First, choose your topic and look for sources available.
* Before start coding and integrate data, propose some interesting questions you could answer with the data you have.


## Deliverables
* Slides (we will provide the template)
* A zeppelin notebook with the insights
